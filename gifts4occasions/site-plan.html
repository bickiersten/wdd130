      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[Is there a holiday coming up that you forgot to buy gifts for? Look no further! My site is perfect 
        for those that tend to wait until the last minute when buying gifts for others. With a few different 
        options, a buyer will be able to pick between price ranges of what they would like to purchase and, 
        because the selection is on the smaller side, choosing what to send is a walk in the park. The gift can 
        then be sent directly to a person. As there is only a small selection of gifts to choose from, we will take 
        suggestions as to what people would want for the upcoming holiday. So, when your memory gets the 
        best of you, visit our site to pick out the best gift for anyone!]</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>[The target audience for this site are people with procrastination skills, or those who tend to put things off until the last minute, as well as people who have a hard time deciding what to get others. Waiting last minute is no problem for Gifts 4 Occasions as it gives a package with certain gifts in a set for people who are indecisive. It also allows those who wait last minute to order quickly and easily, meaning their package will be able to get to that special person quicker and easier.]</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>
        [Welcome to the shopping area of Gifts 4 Occasions! We try to make this part of the process fast and easy without too much of a hassle. Due to the nature of this company, we will only show gifts for the next two upcoming holidays. For example, Fourth of July gifts will be published alongside Halloween gifts. Then, once a holiday passes, that holiday will be up for another two weeks before the holiday proceeding the next holiday will be put up. We hope that by using this process, we will be giving enough time for those who were a little more forgetful about when the holiday was and needed more time to purchase a gift.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Now, down below, you will notice two separate categories. The first category is that of the soonest upcoming holiday. The second category is the next holiday proceeding the first labeled holiday. They are both labeled with which holiday it is, when the holiday is, and how long we will keep those certain items in stock for. Underneath each holiday are three different gift types. The first gift is the least expensive type, varying anywhere between $10 to $20, depending on the holiday and item that is being sold. The second gift is a little more expensive, with a price range between $25 and $50. The third gift type is the most expensive, with a price range between $50 and $100.Now, all that's left is to decide with price range fits the occasion and purchase it!]

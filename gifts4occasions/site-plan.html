      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[Is there a holiday coming up that you forgot to buy gifts for? Look no further! My site is perfect 
        for those that tend to wait until the last minute when buying gifts for others. With a few different 
        options, a buyer will be able to pick between price ranges of what they would like to purchase and, 
        because the selection is on the smaller side, choosing what to send is a walk in the park. The gift can 
        then be sent directly to a person. As there is only a small selection of gifts to choose from, we will take 
        suggestions as to what people would want for the upcoming holiday. So, when your memory gets the 
        best of you, visit our site to pick out the best gift for anyone!]</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>[The target audience for this site are people with procrastination skills, or those who tend to put things off until the last minute, as well as people who have a hard time deciding what to get others. Waiting last minute is no problem for Gifts 4 Occasions as it gives a package with certain gifts in a set for people who are indecisive. It also allows those who wait last minute to order quickly and easily, meaning their package will be able to get to that special person quicker and easier.]</p>  <!-- change this -->

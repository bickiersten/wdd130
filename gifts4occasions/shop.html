            <p class="paragraph">Welcome to the shopping area of Gifts 4 Occasions! We try to make this part of the process fast and easy without too much of a hassle. Due to the nature of this company, we will only show gifts for the next two upcoming holidays. For example, Fourth of July gifts will be published alongside Halloween gifts. Then, once a holiday passes, that holiday will be up for another two weeks before the holiday proceeding the next holiday will be put up. We hope that by using this process, we will be giving enough time for those who were a little more forgetful about when the holiday was and needed more time to purchase a gift.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="para4">
            <p class="paragraph">Now, down below, you will notice two separate categories. The first category is that of the soonest upcoming holiday. The second category is the next holiday proceeding the first labeled holiday. They are both labeled with which holiday it is, when the holiday is, and how long we will keep those certain items in stock for. Underneath each holiday are three different gift types. The first gift is the least expensive type, varying anywhere between $10 to $20, depending on the holiday and item that is being sold. The second gift is a little more expensive, with a price range between $25 and $50. The third gift type is the most expensive, with a price range between $50 and $100.Now, all that's left is to decide with price range fits the occasion and purchase it!</p>

    <h2>Kiersten Bickmore</h2>
    <p>Hi Everyone!</p>
    <p>I'm Kiersten Bickmore and currently, I am majoring in Business Finance while minoring in something I love to do, which is photography. I'm from Colorado, but I grew up moving all over the place because of my dad's job. Because of that, I was born in Hong Kong and I was also able to live in England for a few years, though I was pretty young. Other than those two places, I've moved mainly around the United States, from the east coast to the west coast.</p>
    <p>I am the second youngest of 8 and I have loved being able to grow up in a larger family. Through the years, I've found that playing games, whether it's card games or board games, is one of my favorite things to do with others to pass the time. I'm also big into watching a variety of shows and movies, espeically scary ones.</p>
